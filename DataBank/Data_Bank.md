# Data Bank Case Study

## Introduction

There is a new innovation in the financial industry called **Neo-Banks**: digital-only banks without physical branches.  

Danny thought there should be an intersection between Neo-Banks, cryptocurrency, and data — so he launched **Data Bank**.  

Data Bank operates like a digital bank but also provides the world’s most secure distributed data storage platform. Customers are allocated **cloud storage limits** linked to their account balances.  

The Data Bank management team wants to **increase customer base** and **track data storage usage**. This case study focuses on calculating key metrics, customer growth, and usage analysis to support strategic planning.
